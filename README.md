# iak3d
Increment-averaged kriging for 3D prediction of soil properties

Downlad the git repository, open the RStudio project `iak3d.Rproj`

Run the script `egEdgeroi.R` from the project to make the example from Edgeroi dataset (data from GSIF and ithir packages) run to predict clay content.

Successful completion should look like `Error in eval(ei, envir) : Fitting and validation done!`
